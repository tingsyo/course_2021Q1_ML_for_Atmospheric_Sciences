    "\n",
    "### Raw Data\n",
    "The details of the data is described in the [official document](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_CDR_GRIDSAT-B1_V2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The downloaded NOAA-GridSta-B1 image are stored in netCDF4 format (.nc file). The main variable, brightness temperature data, was stored in int16 as 'irwin_cdr', with a scale factor of 0.01 and offset of 200. The missing values is flagged as -31999.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "1. Read raw data: -70' to 69.93'N, -180' to 179.94'E, with 0.07' intervals. shape=(2000, 5143)\n",
    "2. Crop to East Asia region (100-160E, 0-60N) -> shape=(858,858) \n",
    "3. Resize the cropped data into a domain of (2^N, 2^N) for better processing. (using opencv2)\n",
    "    - cv2.resize(512,512) -> (512,512)\n",
    "    - cv2.resize(256,256) -> (256,256)\n",
    "4. Rescale the values of white temperature to (0,1). (divided by the max value)\n",
